GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

Database Design
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

Feature Breakdown
1. API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

API Security
Authentication
Purpose: Verifies user identities before granting access.
Implementation: OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and API key-based authentication.
Importance: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data and ensures only legitimate users interact with the system.

Authorization
Purpose: Determines user permissions and access control.
Implementation: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).
Importance: Ensures users have access only to resources relevant to their roles, minimizing security risks.

Rate Limiting
Purpose: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a timeframe.
Implementation: Implemented via API Gateway or middleware such as NGINX or Cloudflare.
Importance: Protects against DDoS attacks, ensuring fair resource distribution and system stability.

Data Encryption
Purpose: Secures data in transit and at rest.
Implementation: TLS/SSL encryption for communication, AES encryption for stored data.
Importance: Prevents unauthorized interception or data leakage.

Input Validation & Sanitization
Purpose: Prevents injection attacks and ensures data integrity.
Implementation: Strict validation rules and escaping user input.
Importance: Protects against SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other attack vectors.

Logging & Monitoring
Purpose: Tracks activity for security audits and incident response.
Implementation: Centralized logging with ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and real-time monitoring tools.
Importance: Detects unusual activities and enables proactive threat mitigation.

Security Testing
Purpose: Identifies vulnerabilities through systematic analysis.
Implementation: Automated security scans, penetration testing, and static code analysis tools like SonarQube.
Importance: Ensures vulnerabilities are mitigated before deployment, strengthening overall security posture.
